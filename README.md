# enauto_examples
Code examples for working with Cisco ENAUTO sandboxes (DNAC, SD-WAN, Meraki)

Here are some modules to start programmatically with interacting with DNAC, SD-WAN and Meraki. 
All of these modules include the means by which to authenticate to each platform in the class constructor. (each platform handles this differently) 

The SD-WAN module includes code to retrieve information and code to configure, including configuration examples. 

The DNAC module at this time only includes retrieval functions, (I will add configuration functions once a reservable instance is available). 

The Meraki code will include retrieval and configuration functionality once it is pushed to the repo.
