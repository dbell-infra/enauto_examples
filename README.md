# enauto_examples
Code examples for working with Cisco ENAUTO sandboxes (DNAC, SD-WAN, Meraki)

Here are some modules to start programmatically with interacting with DNAC, SD-WAN and Meraki. 
All of these modules include the means by which to authenticate to each platform in the class constructor. (each platform handles this differently) 

The SD-WAN module includes code to retrieve information and code to configure, including configuration examples. 

The DNAC module includes code to retrieve information and code to add locations and template projects. 

The Meraki code at this time only includes retrieval functions, (I will add configuration functions once a reservable instance is available).
